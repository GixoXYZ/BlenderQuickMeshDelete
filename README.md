# BlenderQuickMeshDelete

## How it works:
This script provides a convenient way to delete mesh components in "Edit Mode" based on the active select mode (vertex, edge, or face). It replaces Blender's default delete keyboard shortcut, making the process more efficient. However, you can still access Blender's default delete menu by pressing "Shift" + "X" or "Shift" + "Del".

## Installation:
- Download "mesh_qucik_delete.py"
- Open Blender's Add-ons Preferences by going to "Edit" > "Preferences" > "Add-ons"
- Click on "Install"
- Select the downloaded "mesh_qucik_delete.py"
- Enable the "Quick Mesh Delete" checkmark
- Save preferences
